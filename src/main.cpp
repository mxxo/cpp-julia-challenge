// Needs to work for n arguments
// Needs to work for any combinations of scalars and n-dimensional arrays
// Inside the implementation, one needs to have access to the whole call tree
// and it should be possible to rewrite that tree or flatten it into one loop
// User defined functions and types need to be inlined and SIMD acceleration
// should be used whenever possible
